This C program determines if a student has passed or failed an exam based on their marks compared to a predefined passing threshold.


Given the current values (studentMarks = 75 and failThreshold = 40), the program will output: "This student has passed the exam."


You can modify the studentMarks and failThreshold variables to test different scenarios and see the corresponding output.


This code is a simple example of how to use conditional statements to make decisions based on the values of variables.
